STCS 6701: Homework 2
------
This repo contains my code and writeup for homework 3 of David Blei's
Probabilistic Models and Machine Learning class. In this project, I take a
dataset of vocal calls from gerbils and apply mixed-membership modeling to understand
whether there exist distinct types of vocalizations and whether different gerbil families
exhibit these types in differing proportions.
